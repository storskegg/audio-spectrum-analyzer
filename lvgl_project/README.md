# lvgl_project

This directory is the temporary staging ground for the integration of the LVGL-based UI that will (I think) be used, and as generated using `v0.3` of the LVGL Editor.

This will be better scaffolded into the project once I've learned the best way to do so.

## TODO

- [ ] Determine best scaffolding in the greater project
- [ ] Tests
- [ ] Napkin-design and implement screens
  - [ ] About
  - [ ] Main
  - [ ] Settings
